Churn Prediction
Customer churn is a critical issue across industries where businesses lose clients due to dissatisfaction or competition. This project aims to build machine learning models to predict customer churn, enabling businesses to identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them
Project Workflow
The project follows these steps:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data to prepare it for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights into customer behavior and identifying key relationships between features and churn.
Techniques Used
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, and correlation heatmaps revealed key patterns in customer behavior:

Higher churn rates for customers with month-to-month contracts.
A strong correlation between high monthly charges and churn.
Key Insights
Contract Type: Customers with month-to-month contracts were far more likely to churn.
Monthly Charges: Higher monthly charges increased the likelihood of churn.
Customer Tenure: Newer customers had a higher chance of churning.
Paperless Billing: Slightly higher churn was observed among customers using paperless billing, possibly due to less frequent interaction with the company
